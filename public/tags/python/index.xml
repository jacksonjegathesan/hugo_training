      <description>Python Variables A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. For example,
number = 10 Here, we have created a variable named number. We have assigned the value 10 to the variable.
You can think of variables as a bag to store books in it and that book can be replaced at any time.</description>
